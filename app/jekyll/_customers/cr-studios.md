## Roadmap Case Study - BLVR

###### July 28, 2015
***

### Pain Points

* Infrastructure could not support our growth
* Use Basecamp for collaboration and communications; struggled to manage complex projects
* With Basecamp, there is no way to determine project progress, nor what projects needed attention. We were completely reactionary.
* Basecamp lacks custom fields and values to provide custom reports

### Solution

* Roadmap integrated seamlessly with Basecamp
* Introduced sophisticated tools:
 * Resource forecasting
 * Milestones
 * Dependencies
* Now have confidence in estimates to clients
* Roadmap prompted us to re-think about how we operate
* Quick to integrate and start using
* Added custom views such as:
 * Deployment checklist
 * CRM system

### Benefits

* **26% increase in total project capacity** by reducing schedule “slack”. How we did it: Decreased lag time between project phases by 80% with more efficient resource slotting.
* **60% reduction in overdue milestones**. How we did it: Using purpose-built views that alert management before dates slip (from reactive to proactive).
* **25% reduction in active (concurrent) projects**. How we did it: The increased project velocity or throughput – because we’re more efficient – means we close project faster. Less moving parts at any one time reduces the potential for mistakes.
