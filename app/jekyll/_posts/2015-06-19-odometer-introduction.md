Time. Time management is the foundation of any efficient project. It’s how we determine how much effort to allot. It might even be the metric that determines how much we’re paid. 

Sometimes we have too little, other times too much. But let’s be honest, we hate logging it. That’s why we created **Odometer**, the new stand-alone time tracker for Roadmap.

Odometer makes it easy to track time. Any time, any place (it even works on your mobile phone!).  Here’s a sneak preview. [Ping us](mailto:support@roadmap.mail.intercom.io?subject=Odometer beta participation) if you’d like to be a beta tester.

Close it when you’re done for the day.
