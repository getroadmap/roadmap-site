## Resource attributes are key
 
One of our clients decreased lag time between project phases 80% by more effectively managing their resources.

They did this by setting resource attributes and searching ‘find by availability’. Setting resource attributes will allow you to select the best resource for the job, regardless of if you have 5 or 100 resources. Oh, and it's a simple fix.
 
A resource attribute can be anything you want (think: skills, location). Our team likes to assign attributes to our developers. A helpful attribute is programming language. We find that our developers are frequently learning new, useful programming languages but sometimes it’s hard to recall what developer knows what. By assigning attributes in Roadmap you know your team –
strengths, weaknesses, and areas to improve.
 
For example, Herbert might be loaded with work this week but we need to fix a bug. We want to search for a developer that works with our London based company, and he or she needs to know Ruby. The attributes we assigned before are location (London) and programming language (Ruby). Using ‘find by availability’ would then look like this.

Don’t have developers or a need for assigning program languages? Not a problem. Resource attributes can be anything you want – as long as you’re working smarter. That’s the Roadmap way.
 
Did we get you excited about resource attributes? Here’s how to create them.
 
Sharing is caring.
