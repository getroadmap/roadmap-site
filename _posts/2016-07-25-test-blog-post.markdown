Sales and Marketing have their tech stack, and project-driven teams are no different (e.g. **Basecamp, GitHub, JIRA, Trello, Asana**). Our customers average 3-5 siloed tools in their tech stack, meaning they lack real-time, end-to-end visibility of projects or resources. Worse, most tools do not support resource forecasting or time tracking. Today, the silos and missing data gaps are handled via spreadsheets.

Our vision is to allow project teams to plan their workload more realistically, balance priorities & risk, and analyze past performance: Using their current tech stack; Supporting future experimentation of new tools; and Not requiring users to toggle between apps because missing (gap) fields are embedded in their primary tool. Replace spreadsheets with real-time, actionable intelligence or suggestions.

Roadmap can become a platform for project teams: integration services and value-added features like auto-scheduling, predictive analytics (e.g. based on similar projects and people, you should push due date out 47 days), etc.

Everyone has projects. We want to make everyone smarter by using data they already have to make more realistic decisions.
