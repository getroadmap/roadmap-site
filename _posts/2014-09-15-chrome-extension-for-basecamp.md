Roadmap is all about giving you the details to make your projects more effecient and effective.

Our new [browser extension](https://ppmroadmap.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/424144-browser-extension-overview) allows you and your team members to work in Basecamp, with the additional data provided by Roadmap. Now, team members can update details without leaving the web app they use most.

Bill, Dave, Ben, and the entire Roadmap team.
