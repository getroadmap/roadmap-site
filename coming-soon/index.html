    Roadmap 2.0
  </h1>
  <p class="">
    Changes are just around the corner, in the form of Roadmap 2.0. Weâ€™ve completely redesigned and rethought everything.
  </p>
  <p class="mt1">
    But rather than wait for us to finish every last detail, we want to provide valuable new capabilities as they become available. Thus, Roadmap 2.0 will be rolled out over time. The two versions will coexist until 2.0 exceeds and eventually replaces the current version. You will be able to use the new features with your real account data during this transition period.
  </p>
  <p class="mt1 mb3">
    We are always looking for customer feedback and if you want to request access to the beta just ask! team@ppmroadmap.com    </p>
