## Information Collected

PPMLite, LLC (“Roadmap” or “Company”) offers a variety of services that are collectively referred to as the “Service.” Roadmap collects information from individuals who visit the Company’s Web sites (“Visitors”) and individuals who register to use the Service (“Customers”). When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Service or registering to use the Service, Roadmap requires you to provide the Company with contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address (“Required Contact Information”). Roadmap may also ask you to provide additional information, such as number of employees or industry (“Optional Information”). Required Contact Information and Optional Information are referred to collectively as “Data About Roadmap Customers.” Roadmap premium (paid) accounts are billed through Amazon Flexible Payments Service (“Amazon FPS”). As such, Roadmap does not collect or store credit card numbers; but we do store Amazon.com account numbers. For privacy policies of Amazon FPS and Amazon.com see Amazon.com. As you navigate the Company’s Web sites, Roadmap may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons (“Web Site Navigational Information”). Web Site Navigational Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on the Company’s Web sites (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked). When Roadmap is contacted for information about our services, or when Roadmap accounts are created, basic contact information will be requested and stored. Basic contact information volunteered in surveys may also be stored. The Company uses Data About Roadmap Customers to perform the services requested. For example, if you fill out a “Contact Us” Web form, the Company will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in the Service.

## Cookies

Roadmap uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company’s Web sites, Roadmap’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Roadmap, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account (free or premium), or filling out a Web form (such as “Contact Us”), you remain anonymous to the Company. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. If you have chosen to identify yourself to Roadmap, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Service, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is sent to your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Service and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Service. Roadmap uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web sites. When you purchase the Service or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company sends to your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web sites, but you will not be able to successfully use the Service. Roadmap may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data About Roadmap Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Service.

## Third Party Cookies

From time-to-time, Roadmap may engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Company’s Web sites. Roadmap may also use other third-party cookies to track the performance of Company advertisements. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after the Company receives it. This Privacy Statement does not cover the use of third party cookies.

## IP Address

Roadmap may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-personally identifiable information. For example, Roadmap may use IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s Web sites.. This information is used to improve the quality of our service.

## Use of Information

Roadmap will not disclose personally identifiable information to third parties; with these possible exceptions:
Where required by law or if the Company reasonably believes that disclosure is necessary to protect the Company’s rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
In relation to custom work provided by Roadmap’s custom solutions partners – only when authorized by a Roadmap account administrator. Roadmap does not share, sell, rent, or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.
If Roadmap is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Roadmap users will be notified before information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
When actions violate our Terms of Service.
Roadmap offers Customers and Visitors who provide contact information a means to choose how the Company uses the information provided. Roadmap may use information collected to provide users with additional information about our services, partners, events, and promotions. Marketing emails from Roadmap will contain instructions on how to opt out of receiving further marketing emails. Customers cannot opt out of receiving transactional emails related to their account with Roadmap or the Service.

## Data Ownership

Roadmap users retain all rights to their data.

## Hosting

The Service’s user data is hosted by Roadmap. Roadmap uses third party vendors to provide Internet hosting, hardware, software, networking, storage, data backup, and related technology required to operate the Service. Roadmap requires vendors to possess Privacy Policies in keeping with and supporting Roadmap’s Privacy Policy. Roadmap takes an aggressive stance on vendor adherence to privacy, but does not take responsibility for vendor privacy failures, and shall not be held liable for vendor privacy failures.

## Data Confidentiality

Other than basic contact information, Roadmap treats account data as confidential, such that it will not be reviewed, shared, distributed, or referenced; with these possible exceptions:
Where required by law or if the Company reasonably believes that disclosure is necessary to protect the Company’s rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
For purposes of support / problem resolution – only when authorized by a Roadmap account administrator.
When actions violate our Terms of Service.
Though Roadmap takes an aggressive stance on data confidentiality, due to the use of third party vendors and vulnerabilities intrinsic to information systems, Roadmap shall not be held liable for data confidentiality failures.

## Safe Harbor Framework

Roadmap complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Roadmap has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.
